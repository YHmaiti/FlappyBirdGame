**->Flappy Bird Game**    

**->C# and .NET Windows Form**    

**Suggestions/Improvements:**  
* Add more difficulty for higher scores and adjust the length of the pipes then.  .  
* Put a more dynamic and entertaining background.  
* Add prefabs/animations for game events such as: game over and jumps (sound maybe).
